This is an open-source `React Library` released under the [MIT Licence](https://github.com/hackdanismo/react-ui/blob/main/LICENSE). This is created by `Dan Jackson` under the `Hackdanismo` `GitHub` account.

## Documentation

## Clone the Repository
The `repository` contains the `React` components that form the library. This requires `git` to clone the contents of the `repository`. Once `git` has been installed, along with setting up `SSH (Secure Shell)`, the `repository` can be cloned locally.
